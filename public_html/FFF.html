<a name="history"></a><h2>History of the Friends of the Fairlee Forest</h2></center>
<p> 
 FFF was founded in July 2012 by Fairlee residents interested in working with the Town to improve public access and expand knowledge and appreciation of its forest environment.
<p>
Since then, the organization has 
<ul>
<li>mapped, signposted, and blazed or re-blazed up to 35 miles of public trails;
<p>
<li>
produced two editions of a printed trail map for visitors, now also available as an interactive online map;,

<p>
<li>collaborated with West Fairlee Conservation Commission on habitat research in our shared wetland;
<p>
<li>organized a public presentation on results of “The Great Fairlee Wetlands” research project by the research team of five well-known conservation biologists;
<p>
<li>held a number of guided tours of Fairlee Forest;
<p>
<li>launched the website "Forests and Trails of Fairlee VT"; and
<p>
<li> organized the Fairlee Forest Festival, a day-long celebration of the northern forest environment and the many ways it contributes to our quality of life and economy The event featured some 30 participants and drew about 500 visitors to Fairlee Village Center on Saturday July 2, 2016. 
</ul>
